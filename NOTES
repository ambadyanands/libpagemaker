=== OLETOY INCONSISTENCIES ===
* Version 6 sometimes detected erroneously.

=== GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES ===

* Height (in tenths of a point) at 0x3C in the first record of the entire file.
* Width (same units) at 0x8 in the record of the first page only.

* Pagemaker doesn't appear to remember which number was entered first. (5.pmd, 5_input_flpped.pmd)
* This stuff doesn't care about portrait vs. landscape. (5.pmd, 5_wide.pmd) 
* Margins don't have an effect either. (2_2_halfinch_margins.pmd)

=== SHAPE ATTRIBUTES ===
(Only tested on rectangles so far!)
* Origin is the center of the page, or double-sided page combo. Positive y is down.
* Note that the first page is considered a right page, so
  if the doc is double-sided, the origin is the left edge.
* Units are 1/20 of a point (1/1440 of an inch)
* Offset is 0x06 for left position, then goes top, right, bottom. Each are words.
